Drum Kit Project Readme

This project is a simple drum kit implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play drum sounds by pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Each key corresponds to a different drum sound, and when a key is pressed, the corresponding sound is played, and the visual representation of the key is animated to indicate the sound being played.
